      "body": "Polysynthetic low-resource languages are poorly treated with standard language modeling approaches. In this paper a hypothesis that word-segment embeddings based on tensor product of representations show better performance for low-resource languages compared to conventional word- and char-based models is tested. In order to prove it a pipeline that allows to process low-resource polysynthetic languages was developed. Using Neural Sequence Labeling Toolkit \\parencite{yang2018ncrf} to train a segmenter on a Chukchi corpus, a raw Chuckchi corpus was segmented and the \\textit{iiksiin} \\parencite{iiksiin} model was employed to create the embeddings. After that we tested them on the language modelling task and evaluated the results, which showed a notable increase in performance compared to regular approaches.",
